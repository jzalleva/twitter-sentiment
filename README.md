# Twitter-Sentiment
This project allows the user to search for a topic on Twitter and track the change in sentiment over the course of a week. My goal was to build a program which extracts data from Twitter and runs a simple analysis. There is plenty of room for improvement but I'm happy with the results of my first project. The results are interesting and it's possible to gather some insights from popular Tweets on a topic.

The user can find Tweets containing a specified word or set of words. Once search terms are specified, an equal number of Tweets from each day of the last week are gathered from the Twitter api using Tweepy. From there, the text is cleaned and run through a machine learning sentiment analysis module. I use TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis, the results are far from perfect, but it captures the general sentiment. Each Tweet is given a score of -1.0 to 1.0 (very negative to very positive, 0 being neutral).   

Once each Tweet has a sentiment score associated with it, it is then added to a SQL database. This is not necessary, but I found it to be good practice integrating Python and SQL. After the data is in SQL, sentiment data is agreggated and averaged, based on the number of Tweets, retweets, and their corresponding sentiment scores.

The end result is a printout containing the most influential positive and negative tweets for each day over the last week. See below for an example using, "Tour de France" as a search term (I've rekindled my love of biking since the start of the pandemic). I plan on adding a graph shortly, the code for the graph's data is already developed and included in the notebook.

3 . Thu Sep 10 - Ned Boulting - On the Tour de France route today, we will see once again from the air the ruined village of Oradour-sur-Glane, the site of the massacre of 642 villagers on 10 June 1944. It is a startling sight, and was recently defaced by vandals, who replaced the word "martyrs" with "liars". https://t.co/MaIkEbMm6O

4 . Fri Sep 11 - Eileen Dewey - @marklevinshow You know what else is an ninteresting coincidence?

All three countries have teams in the Tour de France. I think they're basically the ONLY teams that are "country" teams, unless you count Astana. Weird.
